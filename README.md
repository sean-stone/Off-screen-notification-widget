# Off-screen-notification-widget
This is a prototype/demo application to showcase a widget that prompts the user if there's an object off screen.

I think there's a few different ways this could be used, but ultimately I think it's best with:

- Geometry that moves.
- Geometry that is time enabled.
- When data is spawning off screen (e.g. alerts).

The previous application I wrote that works with multiple data in a feature service can be found [here](https://github.com/maplabs/directly).
